                Intro
            </h4>
            <p>
                2FA is an additional security mechanism in the process of authentication.<br />
                Authenticating means providing proof of identity.<br />
                In the digital world, this mostly relates to you, entering your credentials into some website or online resource, in the attempt to access it and use it in some way.
            </p>

                Disambiguation
            </h4>
            <p>
                Please note that <i>authentication</i> is not synonymous with <i>authorization</i>; they're not the same thing!<br />
                One must authenticate before being authorized: just because you can prove that you are you, doesn't mean that you are allowed to do whatever you're doing ;)<br />
                Hence the two HTTP error codes <code>401</code> (
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401"
                   target="_blank">
                    unauthorized
                </a>, aka "we don't know who you are") and <code>403</code> (
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403"
                   target="_blank">
                    forbidden
                </a>, aka "we know exactly who you are, but GTFO!").
            </p>

                Historical context
            </h4>
            <p>
                Traditionally, people would log into websites, apps and whatnot using only one auth factor: the password. There are many possible means of authentication: something the user <strong>knows</strong>, something the user <strong>has</strong>, something the user <strong>is</strong>, etc...<br />
                Over the years, the one and only knowledge-based factor of "users knowing their passwords" became insufficient (and it's stunning
                <a href="https://press.avast.com/83-of-americans-are-using-weak-passwords"
                   target="_blank">
                    how bad people's passwords still are
                </a>, even today!), so a second factor was introduced: <i>something the user has</i>...<br />

                Conclusion
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the majority of cases, 2FA boils down to adding the requirement of a time-based token (typically a 6-digit number valid for only 30 seconds) generated by a key that only <strong>you have</strong>.<br />
                Ideally, you'd authenticate for example a login on your desktop computer by using your smartphone (a separate device!) as your second authentication factor.<br />
                In a worst-case scenario, hackers would need to gain access to both your desktop computer AND your smartphone to combine password + 2FA code in under 30 seconds).
                This is much better than just having a password that can be guessed potentially unlimited times by determined attackers, don't you think? :)
